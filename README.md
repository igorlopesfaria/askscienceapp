# Modularization

The **ask_science app** app has been fully modularized:

**Scalability** - In a tightly coupled codebase, a single change can trigger a cascade of
alterations. A properly modularized project will embrace
the [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) principle. This
in turn empowers the contributors with more autonomy while also enforcing architectural patterns.

**Enabling work in parallel** - Modularization helps decrease version control conflicts and enables
more efficient work in parallel for developers in larger teams.

**Ownership** - A module can have a dedicated owner who is responsible for maintaining the code and
tests, fixing bugs, and reviewing changes.

**Encapsulation** - Isolated code is easier to read, understand, test and maintain.

**Reduced build time** - Leveraging Gradle’s parallel and incremental build can reduce build times.

**Dynamic delivery** - Modularization is a requirement
for [Play Feature Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/feature-delivery) which
allows certain features of your app to be delivered conditionally or downloaded on demand.

**Reusability** - Proper modularization enables opportunities for code sharing and building multiple
apps, across different platforms, from the same foundation.
